This repo contains an implementation of the famous donut.c program by Andy Sloane. It renders a spinning 3D donut using ASCII art.

## 📚 Description

The donut.c program was originally written 2006. It uses basic 3D math to render a torus (donut shape) and project it onto a 2D ASCII art canvas. By spinning the torus around various axes, an animated donut is produced. 

The code is a remarkable example of compact algorithms and optimizations. In just a few hundred characters of C code, Sloane is able to render surprisingly complex 3D graphics using only basic trigonometry and linear algebra.

This repo contains a simplified implementation of donut.c in Javascript and HTML. A spinning ASCII donut is rendered in the browser by porting the key equations and logic from the original C code.
